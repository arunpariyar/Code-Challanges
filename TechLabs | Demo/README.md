## 🕹 Let's Play A Game ##

### 💩 Level 1

👉 Open your terminal and navigate to your desktop using `cd` command

🤓 Don't forget to use tabkey to auto complete

👉  Create a folder name ***practice*** and get into the folder 

🤓 psst ! it's the `mkdir` command 😉

👉 create 4 files using `touch` command and name them as draft1.txt

🖥 your should now have files `draft1.txt draft2.txt draft3.txt	draft4.txt` in your folder
👉 use the `ls -al` command to make sure you have all the files

🤓 Don't forget you can clear the text on your screen using `clear`

👉 Open draft4.txt and type in "version 1 complete"

👉 use the `cat` command to see the text in the terminal

---

###  👻 Level 2

👉 Rename `draft4.txt` to `version1.txt` using `cp` command

👉 Make a new directory with the name of your Techlabs project

🤓 Smile you silly you are doing great 😁

🧘 Okay focus now here comes the tough part 

👉 Navigate inside the your project folder and create another folder with your track name use UX, AI, WD or DS

👉 Super ! now create file `misc.txt` in the same folder.

🤓 Clear the text on your screen using `clear`

👉 Nice... now, use cd.. to get out the the folder 

🖥 You must now be in the `practice` folder, check using `pwd` Amazing 🎉


---
###  🧨 Level 3

👉 move the `version1.txt` into to folder with your track name inside your project 
folder 

🤓 You will have to use relative path here so.. `./yourprojectfolder/yourtrackfolder.`

👉 navigate inside your project folder and remove `misc.txt`

👉 navigate back to the practice folder and just type this `rm draft*.txt` trust me it works

⌛️ You just learnt about wild card `*` all your draft files must now be deleted with just one command... ain't that cool.
